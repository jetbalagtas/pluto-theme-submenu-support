Adds submenu support for Pluto Wordpress theme

Initial commit (Create screen.css) contains the original screen.css file as of v 2.3 which I edited (Update to screen.css) to provide submenu support. Since v 1.2, users who encountered disappearing and non-clickable submenus were told that it is not supported. The developer only says it will be supported in the next update, if there is enough demand for it. You can read the comment thread at http://themeforest.net/item/pluto-fullscreen-cafe-and-restaurant/534738/comments

(Update to screen.css) adds submenu support to the Pluto Wordpress theme. It contains the correct code to have your submenus appear on hover and become clickable. It also includes a visibility:hidden parameter to hide the corner decorations of the slide-out pages. Just delete lines 1647, 1656, 1665, and 1674 if you like the page corner decorations.
