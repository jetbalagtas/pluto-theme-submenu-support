## Adds submenu support for Pluto Wordpress theme

Contains the original screen.css file as of v 2.3 which I edited to provide submenu support. Since v 1.2, users who encountered disappearing and non-clickable submenus were told that it is not supported. The developer only says it will be supported in the next update, if there is enough demand for it. You can read the comment thread at http://themeforest.net/item/pluto-fullscreen-cafe-and-restaurant/534738/comments

This adds submenu support to the Pluto Wordpress theme. It lets your submenus appear on hover and stay in position so the user can click on it. It also includes a visibility:hidden parameter to hide the corner decorations of the slide-out pages. Just comment out or delete lines 1647, 1656, 1665, and 1674 if you like the page corner decorations.

I have not been the admin of the above named site since August of 2013. It looked exponentially more beautiful before then. Now it looks forlorn with nary a meaningful update, even in content :(
